# dir.example

'dir.example' shows how the ['dir'](https::/github.com/cynkra/dir) package works.

Look at the code and you'll see we have some code in the R folder but also in 2
other folders named "greetings" and "math", were we have another nested folder.

We see that :

* The R files are properly sourced from everywhere
* The doc is properly knitted
* The file starting with `_`
* `devtools::check()` passes
* `devtools::test()` passes

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
pak::pak("cynkra/dir.example")
```
